# 🚀 Terraform EKS Weaviate Deployment

This project automates the deployment of a **Weaviate vector database** onto an existing **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** cluster using **Terraform** and **Helm**. It provides a scalable, highly available, and repeatable infrastructure setup that can be reused across environments like `dev`, `staging`, or `prod`.

---

## 📦 What This Project Does

- Connects to an existing EKS cluster via Terraform providers
- Creates a dedicated Kubernetes namespace for Weaviate
- Deploys Weaviate using the official Helm chart
- Configures:
  - Pod replica count
  - Data replication
  - Persistent storage
  - Affinity and tolerations
- Applies AWS tags for resource tracking
- Outputs key deployment information

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Terraform >= 1.3.0
* AWS CLI with access to EKS
* Existing EKS cluster
* Helm installed (for local validation, optional)
* kubectl configured (optional for verification)

---

## 🔧 How to Use

1. **Initialize the project**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Review the plan**

   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
   ```

3. **Apply the changes**

   ```bash
   terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
   ```

4. **Verify the output**
   After a successful apply, Terraform will show:

   * Cluster name
   * Namespace
   * Number of replicas
   * PVC size

---

## 🧪 Example `terraform.tfvars`

```hcl
region                      = "us-west-2"
eks_cluster_name            = "wv-customer-prod"
namespace                   = "weaviate"
environment                 = "prod"

aws_default_tags = {
  owner       = "sre-team"
  environment = "prod"
  project     = "weaviate-cluster"
}

replica_count               = 3
weaviate_replication_factor = 3
weaviate_storage_size       = "50Gi"
```

## 📤 Outputs

| Output                   | Description                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `eks_cluster_name`       | The name of the EKS cluster used      |
| `weaviate_namespace`     | Kubernetes namespace for Weaviate     |
| `weaviate_replica_count` | Number of replicas deployed           |
| `weaviate_storage_size`  | Size of the persistent volume per pod |

---

## 🧠 Notes

* This module assumes the EKS cluster and worker nodes are **already provisioned**.
* Storage class and CSI driver configuration are assumed to be handled by the cluster admin or a bootstrap layer.
* If you're using this for multiple environments, create files like `dev.tfvars`, `prod.tfvars`, etc.
