# üîç Hypothetical Post-Mortem: Cloud Infrastructure Incident

## üìò About This Document

This repository contains a **hypothetical post-mortem** report based on my real-world experience managing high-severity incidents in cloud environments. While the core structure, approach, and resolution steps reflect actual incidents I have actively worked on and resolved, **all specific details (such as service names, customers, regions, and technical identifiers) have been modified** to fully respect the non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) I‚Äôm bound to.

## ‚úÖ Purpose

The goal of this post-mortem is to demonstrate:

- My structured approach to incident management  
- How I communicate clearly across stakeholders  
- Root cause analysis, remediation steps, and follow-up actions  
- My ability to think critically under pressure and lead resolution efforts

## üß† Role & Leadership Context

During production incidents, **myself and my team were responsible for wearing many hats** ‚Äî including serving as the incident commander, the technical resource, and the communications lead (both internal and external), while also coordinating escalation paths and paging.

To reduce the cognitive and operational overhead on the team, I **spearheaded a proof of concept to evaluate FireHydrant** as a way to incorporate **AI-driven workflows and automation** into our incident process. The goal was to streamline coordination and communication, allowing engineers to stay focused on **technical mitigation and facilitating resolution**. This initiative improved efficiency and set the foundation for more sustainable incident management practices in the long term.

This tool went live **shortly before my time off** and required **cross-functional buy-in from many Support and Development teams** to fully adopt. I led efforts to ensure their **on-call rotations and schedules were integrated into the system**, eliminating the need for outdated processes like **Excel-based paging and manual escalations**. As a result, teams could rely on a centralized, reliable, and automated escalation workflow during incidents.

This is not a verbatim record of a real production issue. It is a carefully anonymized and generalized representation intended for illustrative purposes only.
